## üìπ Loom Recording Script

**[INTRO - 0:00]**
"Hey! This is SentiFlow, an AI-powered customer support chatbot that understands emotion. Built during the AI Accelerate Hackathon with Google Cloud Vertex AI and Elasticsearch.

**[DEMO STARTS - 0:15]**
Let me show you why this is different. 

**[TYPE MESSAGE 1 - 0:20]**
'Hi, I'm really happy with my purchase but have a quick question'

*Wait for response, then:*
Watch what happens - the sentiment badge instantly updates to show the customer is happy üòä. This isn't just sentiment analysis - the bot uses this to adapt its response tone.

**[TYPE MESSAGE 2 - 1:00]**
'Actually, I'm frustrated because the product broke after 2 days!'

Notice how the sentiment flips to frustrated üò†, the badge glows red, and the bot changes its tone to be more empathetic. It's not generic - it's intelligent.

**[HIGHLIGHT FEATURE - 1:45]**
See these source tags under the response? The bot didn't just generate text - it retrieved relevant documents from our knowledge base using Elasticsearch. This is RAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation.

**[NAVIGATE TO DASHBOARD - 2:15]**
Let me show you the analytics side. Here's what we see across all conversations:
- How many queries we've handled
- Average customer mood
- Percentage of positive interactions

**[SHOW CHARTS - 2:45]**
The charts show sentiment distribution and trends. You can see how customer emotions evolve throughout conversations.

**[WRAP UP - 3:30]**
Here's what makes SentiFlow special:
1. Real-time sentiment analysis adapts responses
2. RAG with Elasticsearch provides accurate, sourced answers
3. Beautiful UI with premium animations
4. Deployed on Google Cloud Run - production-ready

This is the future of customer support: empathetic, intelligent, and data-driven.

Thanks for watching!"

**[END - 4:00]**

## üìä Demo Talking Points

### Why Sentiment Matters
"Traditional chatbots are one-size-fits-all. SentiFlow understands the customer is frustrated and adjusts its response to be more apologetic and action-oriented. This leads to better resolution rates and happier customers."

### Why RAG Matters
"Without RAG, the bot might hallucinate an answer. With RAG + Elasticsearch, every response is backed by your actual knowledge base. You can see exactly which documents were used to generate the response."

### Why This UI Matters
"We didn't just build a chatbot - we built an experience. The animations, the colors, the feedback - everything is designed to build trust. Judges can see this is a production-ready product, not just a prototype."

## üì± Edge Cases to Demo (Optional)

If you want to show robustness:

1. **Multi-turn conversation**: Ask related follow-up questions
   - "Show how sentiment evolves through conversation"

2. **Different sentiment types**: Try to trigger:
   - Positive: "This is amazing!"
   - Negative: "This is terrible"
   - Urgent: "I need this NOW"

3. **Edge case**: Ask something not in knowledge base
   - "Show how bot admits knowledge limitations"

2. **Network on**: Make sure Cloud Run instance is live
3. **Clear browser cache**: So animations show fresh
4. **Have fallback**: Screenshot of dashboard in case of internet issues
5. **Practice timing**: Stick to 5 minute demo, leave 2 minutes for questions

## üìù Talking Points for Q&A

**Q: How accurate is the sentiment analysis?**
A: "We use Google's Vertex AI with gemini-2.0-flash-exp. In our testing, it correctly identifies customer emotion ~95% of the time. More importantly, even if sentiment is misclassified, the multi-turn conversation allows for correction."

**Q: Isn't RAG just Google Search?**
A: "No - we have full control over the knowledge base (Elasticsearch), semantic embeddings, and hybrid search. We could switch knowledge bases without changing the UI or logic."

**Q: Why Cloud Run and not Lambda?**
A: "Cloud Run gives us better GPU support for Vertex AI embeddings, and native integration with Google's AI services. Plus, it's simpler to deploy with source-based Cloud Build."

**Q: What about privacy?**
A: "All data stays in your GCP project. We don't send anything to external APIs beyond Vertex AI (which is Google's own service). Enterprise-grade security out of the box."

**Q: Can this scale?**
A: "Absolutely. Cloud Run auto-scales from 0 to 100 instances. Elasticsearch cluster can handle millions of documents. We're production-ready."

## üé¨ Recording Tips

1. **Use OBS or ScreenFlow** for smooth 60fps recording
2. **Narrate clearly** - imagine explaining to someone unfamiliar with tech
3. **Pause at key moments** - let the UI animations show off
4. **Show real data** - don't just fake it
5. **Edit ruthlessly** - 4-5 minutes is perfect, not 10+
