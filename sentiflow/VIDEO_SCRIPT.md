- Keep camera steady

**What You're Saying** (Narration):
```
"Hi everyone! This is SentiFlow - a real-time customer sentiment 
intelligence AI platform. 

In today's customer support world, generic chatbots fail because 
they don't understand emotion. SentiFlow solves that by combining 
sentiment analysis with intelligent retrieval and adaptive responses.

Let me show you how it works."
```

**Visual Cues**:
- ‚úÖ Show full chat interface
- ‚úÖ Highlight header with "SentiFlow" branding

**Setup**:
- Click on message input box
- Type the demo message

**Demo Message**:
```
"I love your product but need help with my account"
```

**What You're Doing**:
1. Type message slowly (2 seconds)
2. Press Enter / Click Send
3. Watch response load (allow 2-3 seconds)
4. Pause and let response fully appear
5. Point to key elements

**What You're Saying** (Narration):
```
"Let's start with a positive customer. I'll ask: 'I love your 
product but need help with my account.'

Notice the sentiment indicator - it turned green for positive! 
The AI detected happiness and warmth in the question.

Now look at the response. See how it's warm and encouraging? 
'We're so glad you love our product!' The AI adapted its tone 
to match the customer's emotion.

But here's the magic - every answer is backed by real data. 
See those source tags at the bottom? This is RAG - Retrieval 
Augmented Generation. The AI didn't just make this up; it 
retrieved actual documents from our knowledge base.

This means no hallucinations, no fake information. Just honest, 
fact-based support."
```

**Visual Cues**:
- ‚úÖ Point to green sentiment badge (üòä positive)
- ‚úÖ Highlight confidence percentage (80%+)

### SCENE 3: DEMO 2 - FRUSTRATED SENTIMENT (60 seconds)
**Time**: 1:15 - 2:15

**Setup**:
- Scroll down or click input again
- Clear previous text
- Type new demo message

**Demo Message**:
```
"I'm frustrated! I've been waiting 3 weeks for my order!"
```

**What You're Doing**:
1. Type message slowly (2 seconds)
2. Press Enter / Click Send
3. Watch response load (allow 2-3 seconds)
4. Point to sentiment change
5. Highlight adaptive response tone

**What You're Saying** (Narration):
```
"Now let's try a frustrated customer. Same scenario - someone 
asking about an order - but with a very different emotional tone.

'I'm frustrated! I've been waiting 3 weeks for my order!'

Watch what happens... The sentiment indicator turned RED for 
frustrated, and the confidence jumped to 95%! The AI is absolutely 
sure this customer is upset.

Look at the response - it's completely different! Instead of 
being cheerful, it's now empathetic and action-oriented:

'I understand your frustration and sincerely apologize...'

The AI provides specific shipping timelines, multiple ways to 
contact support, and a commitment to resolve it quickly.

Same system. Same knowledge base. But completely different response 
because the AI understood the customer's emotion.

This is what sets SentiFlow apart. Most chatbots respond the same 
way no matter what. SentiFlow adapts. And that creates better 
customer experiences, faster resolution rates, and happier customers."
```

**What You're Doing**:
1. Click reaction button (optional visual)
2. Scroll up to show full conversation
3. Point out multi-turn conversation

**What You're Saying** (Narration):
```
"Notice we just had a multi-turn conversation - two different 
questions, two completely different sentiment contexts, two 
completely different responses. All grounded in real data.

The RAG system is using Elasticsearch hybrid search - that means 
it's combining semantic understanding with keyword matching for 
the best of both worlds.

Every source tag is clickable and traceable. Compliance departments 
love this because they can audit exactly which documents were used 
to generate each response."
```

**Visual Cues**:
- ‚úÖ Show conversation history (both messages)
- ‚úÖ Highlight multi-turn nature
- ‚úÖ Click on one source tag to show it's linked

### SCENE 5: ANALYTICS DASHBOARD (90 seconds)
**Time**: 2:45 - 4:15

5. Show second chart (Sentiment Trend)
6. Show recent queries list
7. Scroll to show all queries

**What You're Saying** (Narration):
```
"Now let's look at the analytics dashboard. This is where the 
business value really shines.

See these three metric cards?
- Total queries: Shows conversation volume
- Average sentiment score: Tracks overall customer happiness
- Positive rate: Shows what percentage are happy vs frustrated

These metrics tell you exactly how your customer support is 
performing. Spot trends. Identify problems early."
```

**Pause here** (8 seconds on metrics)

```
"Next - sentiment distribution. This pie chart shows the breakdown 
of all customer emotions we've detected. In this case:
- Most are happy (positive)
- Some are neutral
- A few are frustrated or urgent

Product teams use this to prioritize features. Support teams use 
this to allocate resources. Executive teams use this to make 
business decisions."
```

**Pause here** (12 seconds on pie chart)

```
"The trend chart shows sentiment over time. Are customers getting 
happier or more frustrated? Is a new feature improving sentiment? 
This is real business intelligence.

And finally - the recent queries. See how each one has a sentiment 
badge? These recent conversations are color-coded:
- Green for positive
- Gray for neutral
- Red for negative
- Orange (pulsing) for urgent

At a glance, support managers can see which customers need 
immediate attention. No more digging through transcripts."
```

**Pause here** (15 seconds on recent queries)

```
"All of this data flows automatically. Every chat updates these 
metrics in real-time. No manual entry. No data loss. Just clean, 
actionable intelligence about your customers."
```

1. Open browser developer tools (optional, quick)
2. Show Network tab briefly (responses under 1 second)
3. Close dev tools
4. Scroll footer to show deployment info

**What You're Saying** (Narration):
```
"Let me show you what's under the hood.

Every response is sub-second. This is production-grade performance.

The app is deployed on Google Cloud Run - that means it's auto-scaling 
and ready for enterprise workloads. Millions of conversations? 
No problem.

The AI model is gemini-2.0-flash-exp running on Vertex AI.
The search engine is Elasticsearch with hybrid semantic + keyword search.
The frontend is pure vanilla JavaScript with zero dependencies.

This is enterprise architecture. Not a hackathon hack. A real, 
production-ready system."

AI that understands emotion. Backed by real data. Production-ready. 
Beautiful to use.

This isn't just technology. This is the future of customer service.

Whether you're a startup supporting 100 customers or an enterprise 
managing 100,000 conversations, SentiFlow scales with you.
